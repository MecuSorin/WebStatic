# Successful Guide for Remote Environments:

+ Making it a habit to write _everything_ down when something is decided. No more hallway conversations that don't end up with emails
+ Use git, full-stop
+ Communicate via GitHub or whatever applicable repository infrastructure first, then via email, then in-person
+ "Stand-Ups" should be singular threads in the company wide chosen chat service, that can elevate to a video conference/pair-programming when is more efficient to solve a particular issue that way.
+ Put off meetings until they can be done at a time that works for remote people. The remote worker should be kept in the loop with anything that is business related
+ Always, always, always have cameras turned on when talking to someone remote (emphasis on both sides - is important to see each others' faces)
+ Schedule regular visits for remote workers (once per year, twice per year, etc.)
