Hi there! I hope you’re doing well.

I’m sorry if this Message sabotaged the “inbox zero” goal for you. I’m reaching out today in search for the next project to be excited about.

I am the passionate developer you're looking for: with experience accumulated since 2001 in domains like logistics, Stock Exchange market, finance and administration, GPS tracking and fleet management, custom borders scanning.

Immediately available.

Looking for a remote job (to cut off the traffic time) - I have the required discipline (over 4.5 continuous years of remote work in the past).

I live in Bucharest, Romania (Europe) with my family (wife and 10 years old son) - can travel, but I'm not ready to relocate.


Before dismiss this application, please take the time to read about telecommuting - it may open an opportunity for you:
